Netdata provides advanced Machine Learning features to help you identify and troubleshoot anomalies and unexpected behavior in your infrastructure before they become critical issues:

- K-means clustering [Machine Learning models](/docs/agent/src/ml) are trained to power the [Anomaly Advisor](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/anomaly-advisor-tab) on the dashboard, which allows you to identify Anomalies in your infrastructure.
- [Metric Correlations](/docs/agent/metric-correlations) are possible through the dashboard using the [Two-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) statistical test and Volume heuristic measures.
- The [Netdata Assistant](/docs/agent/netdata-assistant) is able to answer your prompts when it comes to troubleshooting Alerts and Anomalies.
